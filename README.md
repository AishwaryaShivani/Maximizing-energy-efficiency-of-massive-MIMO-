# Maximizing-energy-efficiency-of-massive-MIMO-

Developed MATLAB code and demonstrated: 
•	Examining the optimal number of antennas, active users, and transmit power required for maximizing the energy efficiency of massive MIMO. 
•	Analysis of energy efficiency using ZF processing and MMSE processing techniques under both perfect and imperfect Channel State Information (CSI) for single-cell and multi-cell scenario. 



The aim of this project is to answer this fundamental question - What are the optimal number of antennas, active users, and transmit power? 
Here, I have considered jointly the uplink and downlink with different processing schemes at the base station and propose a new realistic power consumption model that reveals how the above parameters affect the EE. The numerical and analytical results were derived to showthat the maximal EE is achieved by a massive MIMO setup wherein hundreds of antennas are deployed to serve a relatively large number of users using ZF processing. The numerical results show the same behavior under imperfect channel state information and in symmetric multi-cell scenarios.
